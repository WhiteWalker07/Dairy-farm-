# Dairy Farm and Product Analysis


## Background:

The dairy industry plays a vital role in the agricultural economy, contributing significantly to both rural livelihoods and urban demand for dairy products. However, ensuring profitability, operational efficiency, and competitive market positioning requires a deep understanding of sales performance, regional productivity, storage infrastructure, and brand market share. This analysis leverages a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, covering dairy goods sales, to extract actionable insights.

## Objective:

The goal of this project is to conduct an end-to-end analysis of dairy farm operations and market performance, aiming to:

Identify the Top Grossing Product: Determine which dairy product yields the highest revenue.

Evaluate State/UT Efficiency: Measure revenue per cow and revenue per acre across different states/UTs to pinpoint the most efficient regions.

Analyze State-wise Production Contribution: Understand each stateâ€™s contribution to overall revenue.

Determine Brand Market Share: Compare the market share of key dairy brands to assess competitive positioning.

Assess Inventory Health: Classify farms into healthy, critical, and alarming statuses to monitor operational stability.

Examine Storage Infrastructure: Analyze storage infrastructure distribution (refrigerated, frozen, ambient, tetra-pack) by state to uncover capacity gaps.

Identify Leading Brands: Determine the most selling brand based on sales volume.

Track Total Revenue and Farm Size Metrics: Quantify total revenue, number of farms, and cow population across regions.

## Challenges:

Data Complexity: Handling multi-dimensional data with state-wise, product-wise, and brand-wise granularity.

Inventory Risk Assessment: Differentiating between critical and alarming farms for targeted intervention.

Regional Disparity: Balancing analysis between high-performance and low-performance regions.

Storage Optimization: Aligning storage infrastructure with production and sales data for better supply chain efficiency.

## Outcome:

The analysis delivers an interactive, data-driven dashboard providing:

A clear view of top-performing products and regions.

Key performance indicators like revenue per cow/acre.

Market share distribution across brands.

Inventory health status to guide farm management.
